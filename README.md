# Classes in Java

If a single source file contains multiple Classes, all of the classes have separate class files.

# How Java code executes

![](./images/how_java_executes.png)

The Java compiler compiles source code contained within a `.java` file into a `.class` file containing byte code, which is some intermediate language of java, that needs a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to run.

Then, JVM converts the byte code into machine code, by interpreting line-by-line. 

# Platform independence of Java and difference from C++

The byte code of Java can run on all operating systems. 

For example, if a piece Java code compiled into byte code on a Windows system. That byte code can be run on a Linux system as well.

This is unlike in C++, where if we use the [`gcc` compiler](https://github.com/rohan-verma19/learning-C#gcc-compiler) on a Linux system to [convert the Source code into an executable file](https://github.com/rohan-verma19/learning-C#source-code-to-executable-file), that executable can be run on another Linux system but not on a Windows system.

For that, the source code would have to be process using re-compiled (note that here, 'compilation' signifies a number of other processes like assembling, linking, etc) on the Windows system to create a Windows executable `.exe` file.

Executable files contain Machine code (0s and 1s), which is essentially a set of instructions for the computer, that depend on the architecture of the computer's CPU as well as its file system. This is why a Windows executable file can't be run on Linux.

Although Java is platform-independent, JVM is platform dependent.

## Byte code vs. Source code

Now, the question may arise that if we still need a JVM to run byte code, why not just keep the Source code of Java in a `.java` file as it is, and just convert that source code into an executable directly, on each different operating system? 

This is because byte code occupies more than 6 times less memory than java source code. A lot of data/visual representation of code that is required for it to be human readable, is cut out when source code is converted to byte code, explaining its reduced size.

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

JDK provides an environment to develop and run the Java program. 

It is a package that includes:
- development tools - to provide an environment to develop your program.
- [JRE](#jre-java-runtime-environment) - to execute your program.
- a compiler, `javac` that converts `.java` files (source code) to `.class` files (byte code).
- archiver - `jar`
- a documentation generator [`javadoc`](#more-about-javadoc)
- interpreter/loader

### More about `javadoc`

`javadoc` is the official way of writing API documentation. 

We must follow a certain syntax and structure for writing comments in `.java` source files. 

The `javadoc` tool which is included in the JDK, parses a source file and generates HTML documentation from it.

#### Where should we put comments for `javadoc`?

## JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

JRE is an installation package that provides environment to only run the program.

It consists of:
- Deployment technologies
- User interface toolkits
- Integration libraries
- Base libraries
- [JVM](#jvm-java-virtual-machine)

After we obtain the `.class` file, the processes that take place at runtime are:
- Class loader loads all classes needed to execute the program.
- JVM sends code to Byte code verifier to check the format of the code.

## JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. 

It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.
