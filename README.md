# Differences between Java and C++

Java is partially modeled on C++, but greatly simplified and improved.

For instance, pointers and multiple inheritance often make programming complicated. Java replaces the multiple inheritance in C++ with a simple language construct called an interface, and eliminates pointers. 

Java uses automatic memory allocation and [garbage collection](#garbage-collector), whereas C++ requires the programmer to allocate memory and collect garbage. 

Also, the number of language constructs is small for such a powerful language. The clean syntax makes Java programs easy to write and read. Some people refer to Java as "C++--" because it is like C++ but with more functionality and fewer negative aspects

# Classes in Java

If a single source file contains multiple Classes, all of the classes have separate class files.

# How Java code executes

![](./images/how_java_executes.png)

The Java compiler compiles source code contained within a `.java` file into a `.class` file containing byte code, which is some intermediate language of java, that needs a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to run.

Then, JVM converts the byte code into machine code, by interpreting line-by-line. 

The process by which byte code is formed in known as **compile time**.

The subsequent steps where a JVM is required, is known as **run time**.

# Platform independence of Java and difference from C++

The byte code of Java can run on all operating systems. 

For example, if a piece Java code compiled into byte code on a Windows system. That byte code can be run on a Linux system as well.

This is unlike in C++, where if we use the [`gcc` compiler](https://github.com/rohan-verma19/learning-C#gcc-compiler) on a Linux system to [convert the Source code into an executable file](https://github.com/rohan-verma19/learning-C#source-code-to-executable-file), that executable can be run on another Linux system but not on a Windows system.

For that, the source code would have to be process using re-compiled (note that here, 'compilation' signifies a number of other processes like assembling, linking, etc) on the Windows system to create a Windows executable `.exe` file.

Executable files contain Machine code (0s and 1s), which is essentially a set of instructions for the computer, that depend on the architecture of the computer's CPU as well as its file system. This is why a Windows executable file can't be run on Linux.

Although Java is platform-independent, JVM is platform dependent.

## Byte code vs. Source code

Now, the question may arise that if we still need a JVM to run byte code, why not just keep the Source code of Java in a `.java` file as it is, and just convert that source code into an executable directly, on each different operating system? 

This is because byte code occupies more than 6 times less memory than java source code. A lot of data/visual representation of code that is required for it to be human readable, is cut out when source code is converted to byte code, explaining its reduced size.

# JDK vs. JRE vs. JVM vs. JIT

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

JDK provides an environment to develop and run the Java program. 

It is a package that includes:
- development tools - to provide an environment to develop your program.
- [JRE](#jre-java-runtime-environment) - to execute your program.
- a compiler, `javac` that converts `.java` files (source code) to `.class` files (byte code). This is achieved during the **compile time**.
- archiver - `jar`
- a documentation generator [`javadoc`](#more-about-javadoc)
- interpreter/loader

### More about `javadoc`

`javadoc` is the official way of writing API documentation. 

We must follow a certain syntax and structure for writing comments in `.java` source files. 

The `javadoc` tool which is included in the JDK, parses a source file and generates HTML documentation from it.

#### Where should we put comments for `javadoc`?

## JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

JRE is an installation package that provides environment to only run the program.

It consists of:
- Deployment technologies
- User interface toolkits
- Integration libraries
- Base libraries
- [JVM](#jvm-java-virtual-machine)

After we obtain the `.class` file, the processes that take place at runtime are:
- Class loader loads all classes needed to execute the program.
- JVM sends code to Byte code verifier to check the format of the code.

## JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. 

It loads, verifies and executes Java bytecode. It is known as the interpreter or the core of Java programming language because it executes Java programming.

JVM consists of three main components or subsystems:

### Class Loader Subsystem 

It is responsible for [loading](#loading), [linking](#linking) and initializing a Java class file (i.e., “Java file”), otherwise known as dynamic class loading.

#### Loading

Byte code class file is read and binary data is generated, in order to create an object of this 'class' in heap (**loading** into memory).

#### Linking 

- `.class` file is verified.
- Memory is allocated for class variable and default values.
- Symbolic references are replaced with direct references (**linking** takes place).

#### Initialization

- All static variables are assigned with their values and defined in the code & stack block.
  

### Execution Engine

Contains an interpreter, compiler and garbage collector

#### Java Interpreter

It reads the byte code and interprets (convert line-by-line) into the machine code and executes them in a sequential manner. 

The problem with the interpreter is that it interprets every time, even the same method multiple times, which reduces the performance of the system. 

#### `JIT` (Just-In-Time) compiler

- JIT compiler counterbalances the interpreter’s disadvantage of slow execution and improves the performance.
- It aids in improving the performance of Java programs by compiling bytecode into native machine code at run time.
- It is ENABLED throughout, while it gets ACTIVATED when a method is invoked. For a compiled method, the JVM directly calls the compiled code, instead of interpreting it.

#### Garbage Collector

This is a program in java that manages the memory automatically. 

It is a daemon thread which always runs in the background. 

This basically frees up the heap memory by destroying objects that have no reference variables pointing to them or objects which have been corrupted due to overwriting.

### Runtime Data Areas

Contain method **areas**, PC registers, stack areas and threads.
